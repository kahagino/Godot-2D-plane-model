# Godot 2D Plane Model

This is the core project for my game

The model isn't intended to be ðŸ’¯% accurate. I just made it coherent and playable ðŸ¤—

## The diagrams that explain it all
They are inverted but you get the idea

Note that aerodynamic forces apply on the center of lift where other ones apply on the center of mass. This is necessary for the plane stability: he will constantly try to align itself with his own velocity

In Godot, you can offset the point where you apply the force with ```apply_impulse(offset, force)```

Don't forget to rotate the offset! (That was my biggest mistake that took me a lot headaches ðŸ˜Œ) ```apply_impulse(offset.rotated(rotation), force)``` Or the force will not apply at the right point. Of course, it has to follow the plane rotation...
